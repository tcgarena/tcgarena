# TCGArena

TCGArena is an open source replacement for the once popular (offline since Nov 2018) tournament hosting platform magic-league. Magic-league was incepted in 2002, and in its prime attracted hundreds of competitive REL players, as well as many professional REL players.

Our goal is to create a friendly, yet competitive community where players can participate in ranked tournaments and single matches. Just like magic-league, TCGArena will have weekly trial tournaments, and larger free-to-enter monthly tournaments with cash prizes. 

We will be using cockatrice (rooster ranges server) as we develop the core features of our app, but we plan to support other platforms in the future.

## Core Features

   - Round-the-clock mini tournaments

 ### Future updates
